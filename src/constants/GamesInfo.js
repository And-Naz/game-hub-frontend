		description: "Little Big Snake is the ultimate slither style game. You may be big but it'll take more than that to survive in the dewy world of Ambrosia! Little Big Snake is a slippery game of serpentine fun. On the jungle floor, deep beneath its leafy canopy, you are forced to defend yourself from a wide variety of potential threats using only your mouse and some hard-earned upgrades. In Little Big Snake you start off as a small, wormy looking serpent that has to eat, smash, and slither its way up the food chain. If you want to thrive and not just survive, you'll have to swallow nectar, kill Jujas --the jungles resident pest-- and eat all manner of disgusting insects. But beware! For Little Big Snake is a Massive Multiplayer Online game and that means you won't be the only snake looking to climb up the leader board.The MMO aspect of Little Big Snake means that the jungle is an arena and you'll be pitted against other players who are hungry for the same evolution as you. If you want to win you'll have to be sneaky! Never attack an opposing snake head-on, this will certainly end in your death. The way you kill other snakes is by tricking them into smashing into you or surrounding them and strangling them to death within a swirling vortex of your own scaled body. Each opposing snake you kill will leave a trail of nectar which will help you grow. The larger you grow and the more enemies you kill, the higher your reward in coins. You can use your coins between levels to upgrade various aspects of your snake. Everything from your speed, agility, and even your creepy skin. Little Big Snake is an addictive snake game that pits you and your creepy crawler against an army of players from all over the world. If you think you're ready for the challenge then why not jump on in and sneak around? Welcome to the pit! Game Instructions: Use your mouse to control your snake. Avoid hitting other snakes head-on, this will kill you. Surround snakes and the creepy crawlers of the forest in order to kill them and feed upon the nectar left in their wake.",
